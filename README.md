# Blue Skies Hackathon

**Context (Backstory):**

Bowser, furious that Mario has saved Peach for the millionth time, has decided to nuke all of Mushroom Kingdom. Miraculously, the local grocery store is completely safe and unharmed by this nuke. Mario must survive for 30 days, but must go out and purchase groceries to eat. Help Mario not fall at the hands of Bowser's pollutants on the way there by deciding whether he should go out on that day! 

**Game Mechanics:**

Data for the elements Benzene, Carbon Monoxide, or Titanium Dioxide are randomly selected from the AirQualityUCI.csv file. Depending on how much of the element there is, Mario may lose health, or gain health (via eating his groceries if not max) because the levels of the pollutant on that day are low. Note that Mario takes passive damage after 3 days of sleeping, becuase obviously, he is very hungry.

**How To Play:**

Essentially, this is a luck-based game. There is a health bar and you choose the element that the nuke has sprung out (Benzene [easy], Carbon Monoxide [Medium], Titanium Dioxide [Hard]). You are presented with two buttons, leave castle or stay home. Survive for 30 days to win!

**Note: Depending on Internet Speeds or Computation power, the application may take up to 10 seconds to boot up. Reason being that the app grabs ~30000 lines worth of pollution data and filters it.**
